# Calypo House Business Plan

## Background
Mutation, it is the key to our evolution...

This Business idea was first presented in 2020 during the Covid Pandemic. The idea was to provide the elderly in our family with a big and confortable home where they they could live happily ever after. That house would also provide a first "Housing investment" for the people in the family that don't currently own a house.

A place where the owners of the house could leave their stuff and come to back whenever they wanted to.

A place for family reunions and for planning "new business" as well as a learning centre where we could share ideas, etc...

## Pros
* Place for the elderly to live with high commodities and a garden
* Allows them to rent their other houses
* More quiet than Madrid
* Storage house for vehicles and other goods
* Place for meetings among ourselves and other family members
* Possibility to rent other parts of the house (If we wanted to) 
* If the elderly pay, less money it will cost us

## Cons
* It is not Madrid, therefore lacking Metro and Bus facilities. Cars are needed
* Perhaps harder to rent than other places, but we were told that renting in calypo is easy 
* It doesn't have a swimming pool

## Why we need to do it soon
* Interests are going up
* The elderly are getting older, as we all are. But one year in my book is not the same as theirs
* The house we saw is ready to go! it has central heating for the winter time


## Observations
* House is a long term investment, therefore if in the future it needs to be sold we won't be in a hurry
* There are many people saying that a recession is comming,
